# Security Update: Client-Side Credentials Exposure Fix

## Summary of Changes

This update addresses a critical security vulnerability where sensitive credentials were being exposed in client-side code. The following changes have been implemented:

1. **Removed client-side credentials exposure**:
   - Removed environment variables from being included in the client-side bundle through Vite's `define` configuration
   - Created a server-side authentication endpoint instead

2. **Added server-side authentication**:
   - Created a new `/api/login` endpoint that securely validates credentials on the server
   - Updated the `AuthContext` to use this endpoint instead of client-side validation

3. **Updated configuration approach**:
   - All sensitive configuration is now handled exclusively by the server
   - Client-side code now makes authenticated API requests to the server

4. **Added development proxy configuration**:
   - Added a development proxy in Vite to forward API requests to the backend server
   
5. **Added GitHub configuration endpoint**:
   - Created a new `/api/github-config` endpoint that securely provides GitHub configuration status
   - Removed direct GitHub token access from client-side code
   - GraphQL mutations now use server-side token for GitHub API access

6. **Updated resolver token handling**:
   - Modified GraphQL resolvers to use environment variables for GitHub token
   - Allowed empty token parameters from client for improved security

## Security Best Practices

1. **Never expose sensitive credentials in client code**: 
   - Client-side JavaScript is visible to all users
   - Any secrets defined in client code can be viewed by inspecting the source

2. **Keep all sensitive configuration on the server**:
   - Store all API tokens, passwords and sensitive configuration on the server-side only
   - Use environment variables for configuration, not hard-coded values

3. **Use proper authentication patterns**:
   - Validate credentials on the server, not in client code
   - Consider using JWT tokens or session-based authentication for more secure implementations

4. **Securely handle API tokens**:
   - Never pass API tokens from client to server - retrieve them from environment variables
   - Create dedicated endpoints for checking configuration status without exposing credentials
   - Use empty token parameters from client when server-side token is available

5. **Protect sensitive operations**:
   - Require authentication for sensitive operations
   - Apply least privilege principle when granting permissions

## How to Run the Application

1. Copy `.env.example` to `.env` in the root directory and fill in your configuration values
2. Start the application using Docker Compose or local development method as described in README.md
3. All sensitive credentials are now securely handled by the server

## Future Recommendations

1. Consider implementing a more robust authentication system with JWT tokens
2. Add rate limiting to the login endpoint to prevent brute-force attacks
3. Set up HTTPS in production environments to encrypt all communication
4. Add role-based access control for different levels of application access
5. Implement an audit log for tracking sensitive operations
6. Consider implementing GitHub OAuth instead of personal access tokens
7. Add two-factor authentication for admin access
